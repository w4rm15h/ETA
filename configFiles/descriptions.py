                            dark jailcell. Bad things have happened here, 
                            faint sounds of screams haunt the long, narrow,
                            stone hallways. The old cell doors 
                            lie direcetly NORTH, their bars rusty, 
                            weakened with age.
                            Fingernail scratchings, torn deep into the EAST wall, 
                            casted warped, disturbing shadows.
                            To the SOUTH, a small WINDOW, let in 
                            an ominious blue glow, that helped illuminate 
                            the small cell but also gave a chilling breeze. 
                            A wooden desk is chained and bolted to 
                            the shadowy WEST wall.
                            Despite the rot in the old wood,
                            The dust on top was fresh.
                            Someone was here... 
                            Recently.

                            You can feel the rust digging into your
                            skin, all you see is darkness.
                            The screams echoing through the

BRB, i want to make a keylogger,
I will return when i am not as bored of the same project. 


THINGS TO DO. 

1. Make sure the cell level and all the functions are working correctly
2. Have a look into audio to play music if player wants. 
3. Add weapon function
4. Add armor function
5. Make a YES OR NO FUNCTION for global use. 
6. Finish hub options. 
7. battle function << or at least start it. 
8. Make sure everything is saving/loading correctly. // Fixed
9. Rewrite the inv function, have a seperate loop.

remove cell key after use in jail cell << After testing 

try print on same line using

sys.stdout.write('\r'+b) >> moves curser up one line. 
Maybe try it out on a new project first before you start fucking things up!!!!!!
